# Plebnet Playground Sandbox Automated Cluster Docker Package
This package will setup a set of bitcoind, lnd, and tor docker containers so someone can spin up many nodes in order to help simulate natural traffic thru the playground network. 

If your looking to just run a client node with GUI please visit [Plebnet Playground Docker](https://github.com/PLEBNET-PLAYGROUND/plebnet-playground-docker)
